5. == (equal to )
   != (not equal to)
   < (less than)
   > (greater than)
   <= (less than or equal to)
   >= (greater than or equal to)

6. equal to operator is bascially used to assign a value to a variable whereas assignment operator is used to check if two values are equal or not.

7. Conditions help us in controlling the flow of a program.
   Conditions can be used in several ways, it is commonly used to check if a particular condition is true and then excecutes the block of code, otherwise it skips it.
   This is helpful if we have multiple scenarios.
   Conditional statements include if, elif and else.

8. The first block of code starts from print('eggs')
   The second block of code is print('bacon')
   The third block of code is print('ham')

9. spam = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   if spam == 1:  
      print("Hello")
   elif spam == 2:
      print("Howdy")
   else:
      print("Greetings!")
    
10. ctrl+c

11. break is used to end/exit the loop in which it is iterating over whereas continue will only skip the current line of iteration.

12. All of these will include the values 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
    range(10) only the stop value is specified
    range(0,10) start and stop value is specified
    range(0,10,1) start stop and step value is specified
    All of these will print the same output.

13. for loop 

    for i in range(1,11):
       print(i)

    while loop 

    i=1
    while i <= 10:
       print(i)
       i+=1

14. spam.bacon()
