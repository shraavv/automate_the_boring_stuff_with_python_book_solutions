1. An escape character lets you use characters that are otherwise impossible to put into a string. 

2. \n refers to newline character whereas \t refers to horizontal tab character.

3. By using '\\'

4. This is valid since the string is enclosed between dobuble inverted commas so therefore single inverted comma can be used.

5. We can instead use multiline strings. A multiline string in Python begins and ends with either three single quotes or three double quotes.

6. 'Hello, world!'[1]     --> 'e'
   'Hello, world!'[0:5]   --> 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[:5]    --> 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[3:]    --> 'lo, world!'

7. 'Hello'.upper()  --> 'HELLO'
   'Hello'.upper().isupper() --> True 
   'Hello'.upper().lower() --> 'hello'

8. 'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split() 
   ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']

   '-'.join('There can be only one.'.split())
   'There-can-be-only-one.'

9. To right-justify we can use rjust(), to left-justify we can use ljust() and to center a string we can use center().

10. To trim the leading or trailing or both whitespaces, we can use lstrip(), rstrip() or strip()
